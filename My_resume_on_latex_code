\resheading{\textbf{PROJECTS AND PAPERS} }\\[\lsep]
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Celestial Blossom: A Deep Learning Odyssey for Precise Floral Taxonomy} (Internship project)\\
 \\[-1.1cm]
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep \isep
	\item This project focuses on the fine-tuning of the VGG16 model (pre-trained on ImageNet) to classify images of flowers into five distinct categories: Daisy, Dandelion, Sunflower, Rose, and Tulip.
        \item By leveraging a small dataset of 3520 flower images from Kaggle, the fine-tuned VGG16 model achieves remarkable classification accuracyâ€”97.67\% on the validation set and 95.00\% on the testing dataset.
	\item The UI of "Celestial Blossom" is crafted to ensure user-friendly interactions and seamless functionality while harnessing the power of Keras, Gradio, and Hugging Face Spaces.
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Facial recognition smart attendance app} (Smart India Hackathon '22 submission) \\
 \\[-1.1cm]
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep \isep
	\item Created an app to record the attendance of individuals after facially recognizing them. The ML model was trained to accurately recognize even those with caps/helmets/spectacles on.
	\item Used CNN, Keras API, TensorFlow, OpenCV, tkinter, Python Imaging Lib for creation of ML Model and Flutter Facenet API for app development. 
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{ML Model to predict given song's release year using regression and neural networks} (Side Project) 
\\[-0.7cm]
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep \isep
	\item Worked on a sub-dataset from the Million-Song dataset to train the ML model.
	\item Employed the Seaborn and Sklearn libraries for visualizations and statistical modeling, respectively.
	\item Had a high error rate; explanation can be found in the fact that the predictor gets confused between the original songs and their covers made decades later.
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textbf{Weather Prediction using different ML Algorithms} (Oracle Boot-Camp Assignment Project) 
 \\[-0.7cm]
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep \isep
	\item Relevant Canva presentation explaining the project - shorturl.at/bhlJO 
	\item Applied 6 different ML algos viz. Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree Classification to get a comparative analysis for the model.
	\item Naive Bayes gave the highest accuracy at 84.15 \% for classifying the weather into any of these 5: drizzle, rain, sun, snow, and fog. The dataset employed is Seattle Weather data.
	\end{itemize}
	
\item \textbf{Dog's breed classification using Deep Learning (Transfer Learning)} (Mini-Project) 
 \\[-0.7cm]
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep \isep
	\item Relevant Canva presentation explaining the project - https://bit.ly/3HrpLVZ 
	\item Applied 4 pre-trained CNN models viz. Xception, Inception V3, Inception ResNet V2, and NasNet Large to get a comparative analysis for the model.
	\item NasNet Large gave the highest accuracy at 82.5 \% for classifying the images into 120 breeds. The dataset employed is Stanford Dogs Dataset.
	\end{itemize}

 \item \textbf{Scraping GitHub webpage to generate datasets in CSV format using BeautifulSoup and Requests libs} (Mini-Project) 
 \\[-0.7cm]
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep \isep
        \item GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that assists developers in storing and managing code, as well as tracking and controlling changes to their code.
	\item Used BeautifulSoup and Requests libs of Python to scrape the website to generate datasets according to various topics, which were to be displayed in CSV (Comma Separated Value) format
	\end{itemize}

 \item \textbf{Containerized Machine Learning Model} (Internship project)\\
 \\[-1.1cm]
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep \isep
	\item Successfully designed, developed, and deployed a containerized ML model on AWS infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability for real-world applications.
        \item Created a robust end-to-end pipeline that encompasses data preprocessing, model training, containerization, and deployment, streamlining the process for efficient model maintenance and updates.
	\item Implemented cost-effective AWS resources and optimized the architecture to achieve high performance while minimizing operational costs, demonstrating a strong understanding of cloud-based ML solutions.
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{A review paper on Blockchain Adoption in Food Security}
 \\[-0.7cm]
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep \isep
	\item In this paper, we aimed to address some key questions that will help researchers to further extend their work in the progress of blockchain integration towards the goal of food security.
	\end{itemize}

 \item \textbf{Automating mail sending using Python} (Mini-project)\\
 \\[-1.1cm]
	\begin{itemize}\itemsep \isep
	\item Created a web app to send automated personalized emails to many people simultaneously in 4 different ways, viz., static text, dynamic text, beautified email using HTML/CSS, and beautified email using HTML/CSS (with attachments). 
	\item Tech-stacks used: VS Code as IDE, Python language, Django framework for backend dev, HTML/CSS for frontend dev, GitHub for version controlling and code maintenance, CMD for execution of Python files, and Gmail service for sending mails.
	\end{itemize}
